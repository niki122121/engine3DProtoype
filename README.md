# Prototype of a 3D Physics Engine
My own 3D physics engine build from scratch. It includes the following features:
* Physically perfect 3d collisions for spherical and cube shaped colliders.
* Basic lighting.
* Multiple cameras.
* Posibility of adding textures.
* Posibility of adding any 3D model (by having a file with its vertices).
* Capability of multiple independent scenes (including a very basic menu scene).
* Basic commands for creating games (simple stuff like: moving objects, creating/deleting objects, changing colors, changing scenes...).

Instructions only available in spanish.
Also ignore any compile errors trying it.
