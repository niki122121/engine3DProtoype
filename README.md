# Prototype of a 3D Physics Engine
My own 3D physics engine build from scratch. It includes the following features:

-Physically perfect 3d collisions for spherical and cube shaped colliders.
-Posibility of adding textures.
-Posibility of adding any 3D model (by having a file with its vertices).
-Capability of multiple independent scenes (including a very basic menu scene).
-Basic commands for creating games (simple stuff like: moving objects, creating/deleting objects, changing scenes).
